# Automated Garden Waterer
A program to run the watering of a garden with soil moisture inputs and pump outputs.

## MVP - Complete
Using an Arduino Uno, the MVP will be a single pot watering apparatus that checks the moisture of the pot every eight hours and waters when the right moisture levels are detected.

## Second phase
Still using a single Arduino Uno, checking multiple pots with different moisture needs and providing sufficient watering for flourishing.

## Third phase
Moving computation and timing away from Arduino to a central server (possible Raspberry Pi) on local network. Connecting Arduino to wireless network to receive commands from the server and report moisture levels to the server.

## Fourth phase
Move to control pump of irrigation system and have smaller remote moisture sensors.

## Fifth phase
Add photo telemetry of plants to monitor the various of effects of moisture levels.

## Sixth phase
Use telemetry to judge addition/reduction of moisture.
