# Automated Garden Waterer
A program to run the watering of a garden with soil moisture inputs and pump outputs.

## MVP - Complete
Using an Arduino Uno, the MVP will be a single pot watering apparatus that checks the moisture of the pot every eight hours and waters when the right moisture levels are detected.

## Second phase - Complete
Still using a single Arduino Uno, checking multiple pots with different moisture needs and providing sufficient watering for flourishing.

## Third phase
Moving computation and timing away from Arduino to a Raspberry Pi. Connecting Arduino to Pi via USB. Pi then submits raw data to MariaDB on local network.

## Fourth phase
Use historical data in decision making

## Fifth phase
Connect Arduino via wifi

## Sixth phase
Use small form factor arduino with attached moisture sensors that have wireless connection capability

## Sixth phase
Test control of irrigation system

## Seventh phase
Add photo telemetry of plants to monitor the various of effects of moisture levels

## Eighth phase
Use telemetry to judge addition/reduction of moisture
